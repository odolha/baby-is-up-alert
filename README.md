# baby-is-up-alert
Baby likes to nap in the big bed, but when she wakes up, she can be very silent. No more heart attacks when suddenly noticing her with the back on the edge of the bed. By using this app, you can use a phone's cam as motion tracker and receive configurable alerts on another phone via a server (you don't need to be in the same network).
